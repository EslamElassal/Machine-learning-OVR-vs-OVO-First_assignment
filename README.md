# Group 18 Applied Machine Learning Assignment 1 OVR-vs-OVO Classification Using SVM Model

 
A simple and well designed structure is essential for any machine learning project, project template that combines **simplicity, best practice for CODE structure** and **good CODE design**. 
The main idea is that there's much same stuff you do every time when you start our machine learning project, so wrapping all this shared stuff will help you to change just the core idea every time you start our machine learning project. 

**So, hereâ€™s a simple readme template that help you get into our project faster and just focus on your notice and explanations, etc.)**

In order to decrease repeated code shanks, increase the time that can read the code in, flexibility an reusability we used a functional programming structure that focused on split all problems in our project in functions and use that functions many times in many places in the code without repeating the code.
 

**The Assignment :**
-DUMD It is the real dataset about the students' knowledge status about the subject of Electrical DC
Machines. 
-using this data set to implement OVR-vs-OVO Classification using SVM Model


# Requirements
